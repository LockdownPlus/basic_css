# HTML & CSS Webinar [Part 2] - Basic CSS (Tagalog)
Staying at home during the coronavirus pandemic is tough so we came up with the idea to help make this quarantine or lockdown period positive or at least productive through a series of Webinars. 

Through this online training, we hope to share our knowledge and encourage those who might already been feeling the boredom of staying home to learn new skills and eventually highlight these skills to look for a job online that would help them earn extra cash during these uncertain times. As this isn't really a formal webinar, we ask for your understanding and hope that you're able to get some positivity from this initiative. Thank you!
